    "scene": 1,
    "prompt": "A close cinematic interior shot of a four-year-old Indian girl standing very close to her mother, looking directly into her eyes. The child’s face is calm, serious, and unnaturally mature for her age, lips slightly parted as if about to speak something heavy. The mother is kneeling or bending down, confused and emotionally alert, sensing something wrong. Background is a simple 1930s Delhi house interior with dim oil-lamp lighting, deep shadows, quiet tension in the air. The moment feels frozen, like the calm before a storm.

    {
    "scene": 2,
    "prompt": "Medium close shot of the same young girl speaking calmly and confidently. Her eyes hold certainty, not imagination. The mother’s face is partially visible, shocked and tense, as if the words are impossible to process. The room feels colder, shadows slightly stronger, background softly blurred to keep full focus on the child’s expression. This is the first verbal crack in reality.

    "scene": 3,
    "prompt": "A dramatic slow-motion style frame: a steel or glass tumbler slipping from the mother’s trembling hand mid-air, moments before hitting the floor. The mother’s fingers are frozen in shock. In the background, the child stands still, unfazed. Reflections in the falling glass subtly mirror the child’s face. High tension, silence-heavy atmosphere.

    "scene": 4,
    "prompt": "Symbolic cinematic frame. The child stands in the foreground, half her face in light, half swallowed by shadow. The background fades into darkness, removing all distractions.

    "scene": 5,
